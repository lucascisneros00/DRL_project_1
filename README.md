Employing a DRL framework to study the dynamics between households and firms, as opposed to Bellman/Hamiltonian method in classical macroeconomics.
The environment is powered by OpenAI's Gym RL env, and the agents are (for the moment) common DRL algorithms implemented in StableBaselines3 (PPO, etc.).
